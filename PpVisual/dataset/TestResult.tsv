0	0	operating system, brand), your user ID in our games, page impressions (time and page identifier) or payments you make.

0	0	The Internet pages of the Carly Solutions GmbH Co KG use cookies
0	0	Cookies are text files that are stored in a computer system via an Internet browser.
0	0	Many Internet sites and servers use cookies
0	0	Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID
0	0	A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie
0	0	It consists of a character string through which Internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored
0	0	This allows visited Internet sites and servers to differentiate the individual browser of the dats subject from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies
0	0	A specific Internet browser can be recognized and identified using the unique cookie ID.
0	0	Through the use of cookies, the Carly Solutions GmbH Co KG can provide the users of this website with more user-friendly services that would not be possible without the cookie setting.
0	0	By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our website can be optimized with the user in mind
0	0	Cookies allow us, as previously mentioned, to recognize our website users
0	0	The purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to utilize our website
0	0	The website user that uses cookies, e.g
0	0	does not have to enter access data each time the website is accessed, because this is taken over by the website, and the cookie is thus stored on the userâs computer system
0	0	Another example is the cookie of a shopping cart in an online shop
0	0	The online store remembers the articles that a customer has placed in the virtual shopping cart via a cookie.
0	0	The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our website by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies
0	0	Furthermore, already set cookies may be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or other software programs
0	0	This is possible in all popular Internet browsers
0	0	If the data subject deactivates the setting of cookies in the Internet browser used, not all functions of our website may be entirely usable.
0	0	Collection of general data and information
0	0	The website of the Carly Solutions GmbH Co KG collects a series of general data and information when a data subject or automated system calls up the website
0	0	This general data and information are stored in the server log files
0	1	Collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Internet site, (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet service provider of the accessing system, and (8) any other similar data and information that may be used in the event of attacks on our information technology systems
0	0	When using these general data and information, 
0	3	the Carly Solutions GmbH Co KG does not draw any conclusions about the data subject
0	3	Rather, this information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our website correctly, (2) optimize the content of our website as well as its advertisement, (3) ensure the long-term viability of our information technology systems and website technology, and (4) provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal prosecution in case of a cyber-attack.
0	0	 Therefore, the Carly Solutions GmbH Co KG analyzes anonymously collected data and information statistically, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process
0	0	The anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.
0	0	Registration on our website
0	0	The data subject has the possibility to register on the website of the controller with the indication of personal data
0	0	Which personal data are transmitted to the controller is determined by the respective input mask used for the registration
0	0	The personal data entered by the data subject are collected and stored exclusively for internal use by the controller, and for his own purposes
0	0	The controller may request transfer to one or more processors (e.g
0	0	a parcel service) that also uses personal data for an internal purpose which is attributable to the controller.
0	0	By registering on the website of the controller, the IP addressâassigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) and used by the data subjectâdate, and time of the registration are also stored
0	0	The storage of this data takes place against the background that this is the only way to prevent the misuse of our services, and, if necessary, to make it possible to investigate committed offenses
0	0	Insofar, the storage of this data is necessary to secure the controller
0	0	This data is not passed on to third parties unless there is a statutory obligation to pass on the data, or if the transfer serves the aim of criminal prosecution.
0	0	The registration of the data subject, with the voluntary indication of personal data, is intended to enable the controller to offer the data subject contents or services that may only be offered to registered users due to the nature of the matter in question
0	6	Registered persons are free to change the personal data specified during the registration at any time, or to have them completely deleted from the data stock of the controller
0	0	The data controller shall, at any time, provide information upon request to each data subject as to what personal data are stored about the data subject

0	0	Subscription to our newsletters

0	0	A confirmation e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address registered by a data subject for the first time for newsletter shipping, for legal reasons, in the double opt-in procedure
0	0	This confirmation e-mail is used to prove whether the owner of the e-mail address as the data subject is authorized to receive the newsletter.
1	0	During the registration for the newsletter, we also store the IP address of the computer system assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) and used by the data subject at the time of the registration, as well as the date and time of the registration
0	0	The collection of this data is necessary in order to understand the (possible) misuse of the e-mail address of a data subject at a later date, and it therefore serves the aim of the legal protection of the controller.
0	0	The personal data collected as part of a registration for the newsletter will only be used to send our newsletter
0	0	In addition, subscribers to the newsletter may be informed by e-mail, as long as this is necessary for the operation of the newsletter service or a registration in question, as this could be the case in the event of modifications to the newsletter offer, or in the event of a change in technical circumstances
0	0	There will be no transfer of personal data collected by the newsletter service to third parties
0	0	The subscription to our newsletter may be terminated by the data subject at any time

0	0	For the purpose of revocation of consent, a corresponding link is found in each newsletter
0	0	It is also possible to unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time directly on the website of the controller, or to communicate this to the controller in a different way.
0	0	The newsletter of the Carly Solutions GmbH Co KG contains so-called tracking pixels
0	0	A tracking pixel is a miniature graphic embedded in such e-mails, which are sent in HTML format to enable log file recording and analysis
0	0	This allows a statistical analysis of the success or failure of online marketing campaigns
0	0	Based on the embedded tracking pixel, the Carly Solutions GmbH Co KG may see if and when an e-mail was opened by a data subject, and which links in the e-mail were called up by data subjects.
0	0	Such personal data collected in the tracking pixels contained in the newsletters are stored and analyzed by the controller in order to optimize the shipping of the newsletter, as well as to adapt the content of future newsletters even better to the interests of the data subject
0	0	These personal data will not be passed on to third parties.
0	8	 Data subjects are at any time entitled to revoke the respective separate declaration of consent issued by means of the double-opt-in procedure.
0	0	 After a revocation, these personal data will be deleted by the controller
0	0	The Carly Solutions GmbH Co KG automatically regards a withdrawal from the receipt of the newsletter as a revocation.
0	0	Contact possibility via the website
0	0	The website of the Carly Solutions GmbH Co KG contains information that enables a quick electronic contact to our enterprise, as well as direct communication with us, which also includes a general address of the so-called electronic mail (e-mail address)

0	0	Such personal data transmitted on a voluntary basis by a data subject to the data controller are stored for the purpose of processing or contacting the data subject
0	0	There is no transfer of this personal data to third parties.

0	0	Rights of the data subject

0	0	(Tumblr, we, us, or our) takes the private nature of your information very seriously
0	0	This policy regarding our privacy practices (the Privacy Policy) describes how we treat the information we collect when you visit and use tumblr.com (the Site) and/or Tumblr's other domains, products, advertising products, services, and/or content, including our iOS and Android mobile applications (collectively with the Site, the Services)
0	0	Tumblr, along with Yahoo, is now part of Oath, a digital and mobile media company with more than 50 brands (http://www.oath.com/brands) globally, and a member of the Verizon family of companies (http://www.verizon.com/about/privacy/) 
0	0	The way we handle your information hasnât changed, so this Privacy Policy still governs when you are on Tumblr, using a Tumblr app or interacting with our products, services or technologies
0	3	We may share non-personal information with our family companies for purposes such as product improvements, research and analysis, and to help them provide you with more relevant experiences
0	0	When you use the Services, you also consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy; please read it carefully.
0	0	WHAT THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVERS
0	0	This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of information gathered when you are using or accessing the Services
0	0	This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any information about you that our partners share with us or that we share with our partners.
0	0	This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own, control, or manage, including but not limited to any third party websites, services, applications, or businesses (âThird Party Servicesâ?
0	0	While we try to work only with those Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we don't take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services
0	0	We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of all Third Party Services you access.
0	0	Also: This Privacy Policy doesnât govern what our users do on their Tumblr blogs and we aren't responsible for the information collection and use practices of our individual blogs and bloggers
0	0	One of the great features of Tumblr's products is customizability, and bloggers have a lot of flexibility in how their blogs behave
0	0	When you visit a blog in our network, that blog may collect more information than we do, and may provide information to third parties that we have no relationship with, including to advertisers.
0	3	WHAT WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT
1	1	Account Information: When you create an account on the Services (an Account), weâll ask you for information such as your username, password, age, and email address (âAccount Informationâ?
3	3	We may use Account Information, alone or together with other information, to enhance and improve the Services, such as by personalization
0	3	We use your age to verify that you can lawfully use the Services
0	3	We use your email address to verify your Account and to communicate with you, as described in more detail below
0	0	We also allow users to look for their friends by email address; you can, however, opt out of email lookup through your Account Settings (/settings/account) 
0	0	You can keep yourself fairly anonymous on Tumblr, but remember that your posts, blogs, pages, and username are all visible to the public by default
0	0	People that know your email address can also find your blogs
0	0	If youâd rather be unlisted, head over to your Account Settings (/settings/account) .
0	1	Email Communications with Us: As part of the Services, you may occasionally receive email and other communications from us
0	0	Administrative communications relating to your Account (e.g., for purposes of Account recovery or password reset) are considered part of the Services and your Account, which you may not be able to opt-out from receiving
0	0	We also may send you other kinds of emails, which you can opt-out of either from your Account Settings page or by using the âOpt-Outâ?link in the emails themselves
0	0	Note that we will email you to ask for your password or other Account Information; if you receive such an email, please forward it to us (/support) 
0	0	We send two kinds of email: ones about fun stuff happening on Tumblr, and ones with important information about your account
0	0	You can opt out of the former, but not the latter.
0	1	Information about Your Accounts on Third Party Services: You can link your Account to certain Third Party Services
0	0	In order to do so, you may provide us with your username or other user ID for a Third Party Service, and you may then be required to log into that Service
0	0	After you complete this login process, we will receive a token that allows us to access your account on that service so that we can, for example, post your content to that service when you ask us to
0	0	We do not receive or store your passwords for your Third Party Service accounts.
0	1	Information Obtained from Third Party Services: In some cases, we partner with Third Party Services that may provide information about you.
0	0	 Such information could include, for example, your gender, if you have disclosed that information to that third party and made it available for Tumblr to access
3	0	To the extent we obtain such information, we may use it to develop new Services or to improve or enhance the Services
0	0	When you connect other services to your Tumblr account, those services might share information about you with us
0	0	What gets shown to us is determined by their privacy policies, which are long and boring, but which you should probably read if you have questions or concerns.
0	0	User Content: By default, all sharing through the Services is public, and when you provide us with content it is published so that anyone can view it
0	0	Although we do provide tools, like password-protected blogs, Asks, and Fan Mail, that let you publish content privately, you should assume that anything you publish is publicly accessible unless you have explicitly selected otherwise
0	0	Also, please keep in mind that anything you share privately with another user, particularly through an Ask, Fan Mail, or submitted post, may be posted publicly by that user
0	0	Content published and shared publicly is accessible to everyone, including search engines, and you may lose any privacy rights you might have regarding that content
0	0	In addition, information shared publicly may be copied and shared throughout the Internet, including through actions or features native to the Services, such as reblogging
0	0	At its heart, Tumblr is a public platform
0	0	Donât be afraid to share amazing things, but do understand that it can be hard to completely remove things from the internet once theyâve been reblogged a few times.
0	0	Native Actions: The Services allow you to perform native actions that are integral to our products, such as liking a post, reblogging a post, replying to a post, and following a blog
0	0	Liking, reblogging, and replying are public actions â?anyone can expand the ânotesâ?view on a post, for example, to see who liked, reblogged, or replied to a post
3	3	We use information about native actions to improve the Services, develop new Services, and, particularly, to personalize your Tumblr experience
0	0	Personalization using this information may include presenting you with new posts relevant to what youâve liked, providing you with better search results, and showing you advertising more relevant to your interests
0	0	Reblogs, Likes, and Replies are a matter of public record, so if youâre truly ashamed of your desires itâs best to keep them to yourself
0	0	But why? Be proud of who you are
0	0	Weâre looking you in the eyes and telling you how beautiful you are.
0	1	Information About User Content: In some cases, we may collect information about content you provide to the Services.
0	0	 For example, when it's included as part of your images, we may collect information describing your camera, camera settings, or EXIF information (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchangeable_image_file_format) 
0	0	This information allows us to improve the Services and provide additional features and functionality.
0	1	Financial Information: We will sometimes collect financial information, such as information related to your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information)
0	0	This happens when you decide to purchase a paid Service
0	0	We do not, however, store that financial information; such information is stored by our payment processor (the Payment Processor), and use and storage of that information is governed by the Payment Processorâs applicable terms of service (http://www.authorize.net/company/terms/) and privacy policy (http://www.authorize.net/company/privacy/) (the Payment Processor may also have other terms, and you are responsible for locating and familiarizing yourself with those terms, as applicable)
0	0	We do receive certain information from our Payment Processor: (1) a unique token that we connect with your Account to enable you to make further purchases using the information stored by our Payment Processor and (2) in certain cases, the last four digits of the credit card number associated with that token, so that we can prevent fraudulent transactions and identity theft.
0	1	Information Related to Use of the Services: We collect information about how people use the Services, including those with an Account
0	0	This type of information may be collected in our log files each time you interact with (i.e., make a request to) the Services
0	0	We use internal tools and third party applications and services (like Google Analytics or comScore) to collect and analyze this information
1	0	Some of this information may also be associated with the Internet Protocol Address (âIP Addressâ? used to access the Services; some may be connected with your Account; and some may only be collected and used in aggregate form (as a statistical measure that wouldnât identify you or your Account)
3	1	We also collect your IP Address when you make a post, particularly when you submit an anonymous âAsk.â?We may use this information about how you and others interact with the Services for a number of things generally related to enhancing, improving, protecting, and developing new Services, including but not limited to: providing users with personalized content; providing users with targeted advertising; improving our search results; identifying trending or popular content; fighting spam, malware, identity theft and generally keeping our users and community safe; and for legal and safety reasons as set forth in âInformation Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others.â?We use information about how you interact with Tumblr in order to personalize it for you, to keep both you and our community safe from harm, and to improve Tumblr for everyone who uses it.
0	0	Information Related to Your Web Browser: We automatically receive and record information from your web browser when you interact with the Services, such as your browser type and version, what sort of device you are using, your operating system and version, your language preference, the website or service that referred you to the Services, the date and time of each request you make to the Services, your screen display information, and information from any cookies we have placed on your web browser (as described below)
0	0	We also sometimes detect whether you are using certain web browser extensions and store that information in a manner associated with your Account
3	0	We use web browser-related information to enhance and improve the Services.
1	1	Location Information: In some cases we collect and store information about where you are located, such as by converting your IP Address into a rough geolocation
1	0	We may also ask you to provide information about your location, for example to use your geolocation information from your mobile device to geotag a post
3	1	We may use location information to improve and personalize the Services for you, for example by showing you relevant local content
0	0	Tumblr may determine your location by using drone technology and live video feeds
0	0	Ha ha, no, we just check out your IP address (http://netforbeginners.about.com/od/navigatingthenet/f/IP-Addresses-Explained.htm) or any location data you attach to a post
0	0	Information Related to Your Mobile Device: We may collect and store information related to your mobile device
3	0	In some cases, we, or Yahoo (who we use for mobile analytics and other services), may receive, generate, or assign your mobile device a unique identifier for the purposes described above in âInformation Related to Use of the Services.â?We may also ask you to provide your phone number to enable new products and improve the Services, such as by enabling multi-factor authentication for Account login
0	0	We will always ask you whether itâs OK for us to collect and store your phone number.
0	0	Information Collected Using Cookies and Web Tags: Cookies are text files that may be sent to and saved by your web browser when you access a website; your web browser stores these cookies in a way associated with each website you visit, and you can generally see your cookies through your browser settings, depending on what browser youâre using
0	0	A web tag is code or a pixel embedded in a web page, or email, that allows Tumblr or a third party to see that you have looked at that page
0	0	We use cookies and web tags to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you use the Services, as described above in âInformation Related to Use of the Services.â?Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain information that personally identifies you, and we don't combine the general information collected through cookies with other such information to tell us who you are
0	0	However, we do use cookies to identify that you have logged in, and that your web browser has accessed the Services, and we may associate that information with your Account if you have one
0	0	We may also store unique or near-unique identifiers that we associate with your Account in our cookies
0	0	This information, in turn, is sometimes used as described above in âInformation Related to Use of the Services.â?Most web browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your web browser) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways
0	0	If you disable cookies, you won't be able to log into your Account, and so wonât be able to use the vast majority of our Services; as such, we don't recommend disabling your cookies when using the Services
0	0	Some services that we use (including Third Party Services), such as Google Analytics (http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/) , use web tags and may also place their own cookies on your browser, and individual blogs on our network may contain code that places their own cookies
0	0	We also run limited-time studies using web tags, sometimes with third parties, to, for example, measure the effectiveness of our advertising or email
0	0	Note that, unless otherwise disclosed, this Privacy Policy covers _our_ use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties
0	0	Being able to log into your account is one of Tumblrâs many great features
0	0	Cookies make this possible
0	0	Cookies and web tags also let us learn how people use Tumblr, which in turn helps us make a better product for you to use.
0	0	Information About Your Contacts: Certain features of the Services allow you to provide us with your contact lists, so that we can connect you with people in our Services that are also on those contact lists
0	0	For example, you can temporarily connect your email contact information to your Account, so that we can provide you with a list of your email contacts that use the Services
0	0	As another example, you can send us your mobile phone contact information through our mobile applications, which then allows us to provide you with a list of those contacts that use the Services so that you can âfollowâ?their blogs
0	0	We will give you a choice as to whether or not you provide us such information, and we will disclose fully, within the appropriate feature, how we use that information
0	0	We wonât look at (or be able to look at) your contact list unless you ask us to
0	0	Why would you ask us to? Because thatâs how you would find out if any of your contacts are on Tumblr
0	0	We discard this information immediately afterward.
0	0	Derived Information: As described above in âNative Actionsâ?and âInformation Related to Use of the Services,â?we analyze your actions on the Services in order to derive or infer characteristics that may be descriptive of your Account (for example, what kinds of blogs you follow or what kinds of posts you view, like, or reblog)
3	3	We use this information for all of the purposes set forth in âInformation Related to Use of the Services,â?above.
0	0	PERSONALIZED ADVERTISING ON TUMBLR
0	0	In order to provide you with all of this Tumblr content for free, Tumblr selectively runs advertisements
0	0	We, and our parent company, Oath, work with online advertising companies to provide you with advertising that is as relevant and useful as possible
0	0	To make our ads more relevant and useful, we make educated guesses about your interests based on your activity on our sites and services
0	0	The ads we show you often reflect these interests and educated guesses.
0	0	You can read more about our parent company Oath and its advertising partners here.
0	0	And to learn more about how we select the ads you see, you can check out Tumblrâs Advertising and affiliate policies and Oathâs privacy and advertising practices.
0	0	Managing your choices for personalized advertising experiences: If you do not prefer personalized advertising experiences, you may opt-out
0	0	Note that if you opt-out you will continue to see advertisements on Tumblr, though they will be less relevant and useful to you.
0	0	When using web-based versions of Tumblr, you may opt-out of interest-based or personalized advertising by using the following industry opt-out pages:
0	0	(EU) European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) - www.youronlinechoices.com
0	0	(US) Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) - www.networkadvertising.org
0	0	(US) Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) - www.aboutads.info
0	0	(Japan) Data Driven Advertising Initiative (DDAI) - www.ddai.info
0	0	These industry advertising organizations offer web browser-based tools for limiting the use of your web viewing data for interest-based or personalized advertising
0	0	Any choices made via these industry tools will only apply to the web browser in use for the choices made
0	0	These advertising choices are not propagated among all of your devices.
0	0	When using the mobile app version of Tumblr on Apple iOS devices you can opt out of personalized advertising by selecting Limit Ad Tracking in the iOS settings
0	0	For more information about these iOS options:
0	0	Select Privacy; and
0	0	Select Advertising and follow the on-screen instructions.

0	0	For more information about these Android options:
0	0	Select Privacy; and
0	0	Select Ads and follow the on-screen instructions.
0	0	WITH WHOM YOUR INFORMATION IS SHARED
0	0	We never share information we receive from you unless: (a) we have your permission to share that information; (b) we have given you prior notice that the information will be shared, and with whom (such as in this Privacy Policy); or (c) that information is aggregate information or other information that does not identify you.
0	0	Information Shared with and Received from our Corporate Parents: We are a wholly-owned subsidiary of Yahoo, which is now part of Oath, a digital and mobile media company with more than 50 brands (http://www.oath.com/brands) globally, and a member of the Verizon family of companies (http://www.verizon.com/about/privacy/) 
0	0	Because we are a wholly-owned subsidiary, Yahoo and the rest of our family of companies may receive any information we do, and may share information they have with us
0	0	Our family of companies may use the information they receive from us to help us provide, understand, and improve the Services (including by providing us analytics) and in connection with their products and services (including by providing you with a more personalized experience)
0	0	For details about how Yahoo treats the information it collects, please review Yahooâs Privacy Policy (http://privacy.yahoo.com/) , and for the Verizon family of companies please review its Privacy Policy (http://www.verizon.com/about/privacy/privacy-policy-summary) 
0	0	Yahoo owns us and we share with it and our Verizon family of companies.
0	0	Information Shared with the Public Through the Services: As noted in âUser Contentâ?and âNative Actions,â?above, by default, content published through the Services and many actions you take on the Services are shared with the public
0	0	Because this kind of information can be seen by anyone and may be indexed by search engines (like Google Search, or the far superior Yahoo Search), you should be careful about what you choose to disclose publicly and make sure itâs information you want to share with everyone
0	0	The content you create on Tumblr is, by default, public
0	0	This means that anyone can see it, and that search engines can index it
0	0	If these things bother you, take a look at some of the additional privacy features (/docs/blog_management#password) we offer.
0	0	Information Shared Between the Services: We may, if possible, aggregate information about your use of multiple Services and use that consolidated information to enhance and improve the Services, and to develop new Services.
0	0	Information You Share with Third Party Services: You may access Third Party Services through the Services, for example by clicking on externally-pointing links
0	0	You may also choose to share information that you provide to us, like blog posts, with those Third Party Services (for example, by sharing posts to Twitter or Facebook)
0	0	This Privacy Policy only governs information we collect and you are responsible for reading and understanding those Third Party Services' privacy policies
0	0	You can automatically publish the posts you make on Tumblr to other sites (like Facebook or Twitter)
0	0	Thatâs where our Privacy Policy ends and their policies begin
0	0	Make sure youâre cool with the policies of any services youâre considering sharing to before connecting them to your Tumblr account.
3	0	Information Shared with Our Agents in Order to Operate and Improve the Services: In some cases, we share information that we store (such as IP Addresses) with third parties, such as service providers, consultants, and other agents (Agents), for the purposes of operating, enhancing, and improving the Services, and developing new products and services
0	0	For example, we may share information with service providers in order to fight spam, and third-party consultants may have access to information in the process of improving our processes and technology
0	0	Agents with whom we share such information for these reasons are generally bound by confidentiality obligations and, unless we tell you differently, our Agents do not have any right to use information we share with them beyond the scope and duration of what is necessary to assist us.
0	0	Information Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell business assets
0	0	In these transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets
0	0	Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party
0	0	You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy
0	0	Should we happen to get acquired (again!) or go out of business (no way), the transfer of assets from us to our buyer may very well include user information
0	0	They are allowed to use it only in the ways outlined here, in the Privacy Policy you are reading right now.
0	0	Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others: We believe in freedom of expression, and, to the extent reasonable, we try to protect our community from baseless legal demands
0	0	That said, we also reserve the right to access, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is necessary, in our sole discretion, to (i) satisfy any law, regulation, legal process, governmental request, or governmental order, (ii) enforce this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service (/policy/terms-of-service) , including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, trust and safety, or technical issues (including exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of improving security and preventing fraud, spam, and malware), (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect the rights, property, health or safety of us, our users, any third parties or the public in general, including but not limited to situations involving possible violence, suicide, or self-harm
0	0	Donât make us narc on you
0	0	We donât want to
0	0	But we do need to protect everyone who uses Tumblr from harming us, each other, or themselves
0	0	We work hard to balance privacy and community, and weâre sure you can appreciate the challenges in that, and the seriousness with which we take those challenges.
0	0	Information We Share with Your Consent or at Your Request: If you ask us to release information that we have about your Account, we will do so if reasonable and not unduly burdensome.
0	0	Information Shared with Other Third Parties: We may share or disclose non-private information, Aggregate Information, or other non-personally identifying information with people and entities that we do business with.
0	0	THE SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION
0	0	Your Account Information is protected by a password for your privacy and security
0	0	We may enable additional security features in the future, like multi-factor authentication
0	0	You need to prevent unauthorized access to your Account and information by creating a unique, secure, and protected password and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your Account on the Services.
0	0	We seek to protect your information (including your Account Information) to ensure that it is kept private; however, we can't guarantee the security of any information
0	0	Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time
0	0	Itâs really important that you have a unique password for all of your accounts on the internet, including your Tumblr account
0	0	If you have trouble remembering passwords then you might consider using a service like 1Password (https://agilebits.com/onepassword) or LastPass (https://lastpass.com/) .
0	0	WHAT INFORMATION YOU CAN ACCESS
0	5	If you are a registered user, you can access most information associated with your Account by logging into the Services and checking your Account Settings page
0	0	Registered and unregistered users can access and delete cookies through their web browser settings.

0	0	What wonât get scrubbed are Reblogs of your posts

0	0	Like we said before, it can be really, really hard to delete something once it goes out onto the internet, so be sure youâre only publishing stuff that youâre certain you want to publish.
