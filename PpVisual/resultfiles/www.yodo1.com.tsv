3	1	    What Personal Data we collect.
0	1	All the Personal Data we collect, both from you and from third parties about you, is outlined in the table below.
0	0	Before you read that table, it might be useful to explain what ¡°Personal Data??is
0	0	The GDPR definition of Personal Data can be found here 
0	0	Essentially, it boils down to: information about an individual, from which that individual is either directly identified or can be identified.
0	0	It does not include ¡®anonymous data??(i.e., information where the identity of individual has been permanently removed).
0	0	However, it does include ¡®indirect identifiers??or ¡®pseudonymous data??(i.e., information which alone doesn¡¯t identify an individual but, when combined with certain additional and reasonably accessible information, could be attributed to a particular person).
1	0	Identity Data Depending on the game you download, this may include your first name, surname, last name, username, Game Centre ID, social network ID such as Google+ (if you sign up that way), or similar identifier, title, age and gender.
0	0	Transaction Data Any details about payments to and from you and other details of subscriptions and services you have purchased from us (including in-game purchases)

0	0	Aggregated Data may be derived from your Personal Data, but once in aggregated form it will not constitute considered Personal Data for the purposes of the GDPR as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity
0	0	For example, we may aggregate your Behavioural Data and Technical Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific Site feature
0	0	However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your Personal Data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as Personal Data which will be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
0	0	We do not collect any ??Special Categories of Personal Data ??about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health and genetic and biometric data)

3	3	    How we use your Personal Data and why.

0	0	What is our ¡°legal basis??for processing your Personal Data?
